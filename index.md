## SUMMARY
I want to solve hard problems that will improve people’s lives. While consulting has been great for learning (and I have learned a ton), I want to bring my engineering skills to bear on more challenging problems and have more ownership in the outcome. I’m incredibly interested in Serverless computing, Crypto-technology such as block-chain, and machine learning. If there are hard problems, where solutions will have lasting impact, I’m interested.
## EXPERIENCE
### Senior Consultant, **ThoughtWorks**
Melbourne, Australia / Austin, TX *Feb 2015 to Present*
*	Authored code across front and back end systems with multiple languages and technologies.
*	Leveraged cloud technologies to bring scalable solutions to production rapidly.
*	Successfully delivered multiple high value software projects on time and on-budget as a part of cross-functional agile development teams focusing on customer value.
*	Facilitated architectural decisions for clients weighing short term value gains with long term maintainability and scalability.
*	Continuously learning and improving, and helping others learn and improve.
*	Developed mobile applications for iOS leading teams of developers and running workshops on iOS development for clients.
*	Worked closely with user researchers and designers to deliver rich experiences with quality, tested code that anticipated customer desires and drove business value for clients.
*	Managed stakeholder expectations by communicating technical problems in plain English and offering suggestions on simpler solutions.
*	Improved developer work flow and productivity by setting up continuous integration and deployment pipelines that repeatably test and deploy production ready code.
### Core Developer, **Storj Labs**
http://storj.io *May 2014 to Feb 2015*
*	Wrote code along with a remote team of developers, building the first decentralized storage network based around bitcoin blockchain technology connecting unused hard drive space to cloud storage consumers, improving security, reliability, and cost of cloud storage.
*	Implemented two proof of storage schemes for auditing remote file existence based on academic literature in the area of provably secure storage.
*	Developed prototypes/proofs of concept for exploring network architecture and design, including automated provisioning of nodes and optimization of data throughput.
### Senior Research & Project Engineer, **CAMotion**
Atlanta, GA *August 2011 to May 2014*
*	Automated warehouse cranes with unique sway control technology and other safety and efficiency improvement features such as collision avoidance, automatic positioning and side load detection and prevention.
*	Developed and contributed to core research resulting in a prototype real-time three-dimensional collision avoidance system for warehouse stacker cranes.
*	Led multiple crane automation projects from start to completion providing safety and process improvements to manufacturing and primary materials clients.
*	Authored real-time process control code integrating distance sensors, machine vision cameras, and handheld operator HMIs to automate and improve safety of high duty warehouse cranes.
*	Experience in machine vision including research and development of a dynamic feedback system for crane hook position control leveraging off the shelf vision technology.
*	Designed electrical panels for automation systems, selecting components based on requirements and then worked in the field during commissioning, interacting with customers, troubleshooting problems, and installing hardware.
### Graduate Researcher, **EMRL**
Atlanta, GA	*August 2009 to August 2011*
*	Developed a sub-micron scale heat transport model to predict peak temperatures in Gallium Nitride amplifiers. This model was the first of its kind in GaN to account for phonon dispersion physics.
*	Built a coupled thermal-mechanical device simulation in COMSOL to predict peak thermal stresses during device operation.
*	Laid the foundation for further research in GaN multi-band phonon transport; the developed code was used in another student’s PhD dissertation research.
*	Collaborated with a research group at Purdue University to include advances made in Silicon modeling to GaN based devices.
### Consultant, **Risknology**
Houston, TX *May 2008 to August 2009*
*	Provided health and safety risk assessment for energy companies to decrease risk exposure.
*	Performed consequence analysis of oil and gas releases, fires, blasts, and other major accident events as a part of a small consulting team for a diverse collection of energy companies.
*	Focused on running simulations in NISTs Fire Dynamics Simulator to determine consequences of major accident events, including dynamic spill and fire simulations.
*	Wrote high performance processing tools for handling and processing large datasets from output of the NIST FDS simulator.
